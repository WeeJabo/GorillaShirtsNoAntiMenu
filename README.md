# Gorilla Shirts (With No Anti Mod Menu!)
This Is A Custom Version Of The [Gorilla Shirts Mod](https://github.com/developer9998/GorillaShirts) By [Developer9998](https://github.com/developer9998) Which has The Purpose Of Removing The Incompatibility Of Mod Menu's, and Other Mods (NachoEngine's Player Model Mod and "Cosmetx").

I Am Not Responsible For The Mod Not Working, If It Does Of Course, The Mods, Player Model and Cosmetx, Were Made Incompatible For a Reason.

The Source Code Has Been Attached To Get Rid Of Your Suspicion That This Is a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) Or Any Other Kind Of Virus / Logger.

This Will Be Frequently Updated To Match The Current Version Of "Gorilla Shirts".
